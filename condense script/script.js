    1.  Two players will play the game in order. <br><br>
    2.  When a player clicks [submit], he/she will rolls 2 dice,<br>for example 3 and 6.<br><br>
    3.  Player gets to choose the order of the dice. If he/she wants a bigger number 63, they have to choice the 2nd dice as the 1st number. <br><br>
    4.  Similarly next player will roll. <br><br>
    5.  After both players have rolled, player with the higher number wins. <br><br></small>`;
